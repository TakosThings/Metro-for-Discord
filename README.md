# Configure
**Required**  
Discord's dark theme must be selected from the Appearance tab in User Settings.

**Accent Colour**  
You can change the accent colour by changing the `--accent` variable at the top of the CSS file. A list of the default colour swatches from the Windows 10 personalisation settings is available on the [Microsoft Docs](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windows-uwp/blob/53eb5fbcf125c9b189de37a6afb8b50ccc2a49fe/windows-apps-src/design/style/color.md#windows-accent-colors) website.

**Link Colour**  
You can change the colour of links in chat by changing the `--link` variable at the top of the CSS file. In general you should leave this as default.

**Guild Voice**  
You can change the colour of the Voice connected indicator in the servers list by modifying the `--guildvoice` variable at the top of the CSS file. In general you should change only if the default colour (green) clashes with your modified Accent Colour.

**BetterDiscord**  
If you're a BetterDiscord user, you must disable 'Dark Mode' and 'Blue Mode' in BetterDiscord settings.
