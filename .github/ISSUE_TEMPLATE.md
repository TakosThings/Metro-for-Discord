When reporting an issue:
- Make sure you're using the latest version
- Be as descriptive as possible
- Mention if you are using BetterDiscord if it is relevant to what you are reporting
- Try not to report multiple unrelated issues in the same submission, open new issues for them instead
- Include a screenshot  
    - Screenshots must include context. A 10px wide image and saying "This scrollbar" is not helpful at all
    - Blur out information which may be sensitive
